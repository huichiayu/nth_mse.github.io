<h2>2: Forking a repository and collaborating with others<a class="headerlink" href="#forking-a-repository-and-collaborating-with-others" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, when we find a useful new repository that we want to work with, one of the best things we can to is to “<strong>fork</strong>” the repository. This creates a new version of the repository with all of the previous version history, but transfers ownership of the new repository to us. It’s basically a fancy way of making a copy of the repository that we control, but if we ever want to pull in new changes from the original repository, we can still do that!</p>
<p>For this part of the activity you’re going to make a new fork of a preexisting repository and then practice collaborating on make changes to this new for <strong>with your group</strong>.</p>
<section id="forking-the-repository-and-sharing-it-among-the-group">
<h3>2.1 Forking the repository and sharing it among the group<a class="headerlink" href="#forking-the-repository-and-sharing-it-among-the-group" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>First, in order to collaborate with your team, you will need to make a repository that your whole group can edit and push to. In order to do this, your group will first fork a pre-existing repository and then make sure that every in the group has access to this new fork.</p>
<p>For this assignment the “leader” of your group will be the one that “forks” the repository.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Do This</strong>: <strong>With your group, designate someone as “group leader” for this activity. The leader of your group should be someone who</strong> <em><strong>has the ability to share their screen with the rest of the group</strong></em> <strong>and</strong> <em><strong>previously requested and set up their GitHub “Student Pack.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The leader must then do the following <strong>while sharing their screen so that everyone can follow along</strong>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Visit <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and make sure they are signed in.</strong> (You don’t have to share your screen of this part if you’re worried about accidentally sharing your password.)</p></li>
<li><p>After logging in, <strong>double check that everyone in the group can see their screen</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit <a class="github reference external" href="https://github.com/msu-cmse-courses/CMSE202_Git_Started">msu-cmse-courses/CMSE202_Git_Started</a> and <strong>“Fork” the repository</strong> by clicking the “Fork” button in the <strong>upper right region</strong> of the repository page.</p></li>
</ol>
<div align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/GitHub_Fork_Button.png" width=100></div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Once Fork is complete, you should be re-directed to the repository. <strong>Go to “Settings” and click on the “Manage access” tab on the left side.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invite everyone in the group to be a collaborator with “Write” privileges.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once everyone has access, <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> in the group must <strong>clone this repository into their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/CMSE202/repositories</span></code> folder</strong> and then navigate inside of cloned repository.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Question 4:</strong> What is the url you used to clone this repository?</p>

<h3>2.2 Adding files to shared repository<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-files-to-shared-repository" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Working the in same repository can take many forms. The simplest form of collaboration is adding unique files to a shared repository. As long as we only add files that someone else isn’t <em>also</em> adding, it is unlikely that we will crash into changes made by someone else.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, here is a general formula for success when adding new files to a shared repository.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Before adding new files you should make sure your repsitory is in good-standing (no uncommitted changes to preexisting files) and that you are up to date with the remote (e.g. GitHub) version. You can do that by running the below commands:
<br></p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to check your version of the repository and see if you have any oustanding, <em>uncommitted</em> changes. If you have uncommitted changes, you should either undo or discard your changes (if you don’t want them) or your should add and <em>commit</em> those changes.
<strong>Note</strong>: A quick and handy way to set aside changes you’re not sure you want to keep is with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">stash</span></code> command, you might want to do a quick search and see what this does.
<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve taken care of any changes, use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> to bring your version of the repository to the newest version (very-important!).<br />
<br></p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p>With your repository up-to-date, you can add your files and then push them to the remote repository by running the following commands in order:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>FILENAME<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># Remember you can add files in folders as well with &quot;git add [FOLDER/FILENAME]&quot; </span>
git<span class="w"> </span>commit<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;[MESSAGE]&quot;</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>push
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>✅ Do This</strong>: In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMSE202_Git_Started</span></code> repository you <strong>forked and cloned</strong> above, <strong>add a file (with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.txt</span></code> ending) to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bios</span></code> folder. The name of the file should be your first name. In the file put the name of your favorite food. Save the file and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">add</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">commit</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">push</span></code> the file</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there are many ways to create this file such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With the built-in Jupyter text editor (you can click on “Text File” in the “New” dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the Jupyter file browser),</p></li>
<li><p>With a terminal text editor such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vi</span></code> (which we’ve covered a bit already) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nano</span></code> (another option),</p></li>
<li><p>With a GUI text editor such as Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or something like Atom (just to name a few), or</p></li>
<li><p>On the command line itself using a combination of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span></code> or using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> (probably not the most user-friendly option…)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Working on the same file in a repository<a class="headerlink" href="#working-on-the-same-file-in-a-repository" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most powerful uses of Git is the ability to work on the same file as others and the ability to merge all the work together. However, this process comes with some extra baggage and can be a bit challenging at times, if not done carefully. The safest way to do this sort of collaborative work is to <strong>get into the habit of using git branches when adding new code or features to a repository</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to make this a little easier here is a general formula you can follow when working on a shared repository to ensure success.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Before you embark on any significant code development or repository changes, <strong>create a new branch</strong>. Call that branch something relevant to the work that you’re doing so that you remember what you’re working on.</p></li>
<li><p>If the file you are working and plan to update in the repository is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.ipynb</span></code> (Jupyter notebook) file. <strong>You should always try to clear the output</strong> from that file before you commit your changes. This helps to ensure that the output content is not being tracked by git since this content can be large and may include code that presents output images, clutters the code base. To clear the output, do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the notebook click on “Kernel” -&gt; “Restart &amp; Clear Output”. Wait for that to finish (shouldn’t take long) then save the file (this is important)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Once you’ve added and committed your files to your branch (which you can double-check with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code>), check to see if there have been any new changes on the main  branch. If the haven’t been any changes to the main branch since you made all of your changes, you’re in good shape! You can go ahead and push your new branch and submit it as a pull request to the main branch. If you find that changes <em>have</em> been made to the main branch, it is good to <strong>git pull</strong> in those changes to your new branch first and deal with any possible merge conflicts. If you’re sure that all of your changes have been safely committed to your branch, you can check and see if the main has been changed by doing:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>main<span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># this will jump you back to the main branch</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>pull<span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># this should pull all new main  changes into the main branch</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>If you <em>do</em> find that the main  repository has been updated since you last pulled changes when you run the check above, now you need to try and merge those changes into your new branch. This is where things can get a little dicey, be prepare to be patient with yourself as you get used to this process. Once you’ve pulled the changes from the remote repository into the main branch, you can merge them into your branch by doing the following <strong>after</strong> you’ve made sure to pull the new changes into the main branch on your machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>BRANCHNAME<span class="o">]</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>merge<span class="w"> </span>main
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point If you’re lucky, git will successfully complete an “auto-merge” and it will let you know that it’s done so and then you can push your new branch. But, depending on what all has changed, you might run into a merge conflict. At this point you need to look at what file(s) has the conflict and try to resolve the conflict. This can get tricky, so if you run issue merge conflicts, ask your group members or your instructors for help. The upside is, since you committed all of your files before you did this, you can always go back to where you started! If you can’t figure out how to fix the merge conflict and just want to abort the merge so that you can try again at some point later, you can do:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>merge<span class="w"> </span>--abort
</pre></div>
</div>

<p><strong>✅ Do This</strong>: Make sure you’re in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMSE202_Git_Started</span></code> repository you <strong>forked and cloned</strong> above then do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Open the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River.ipynb</span></code> and as a group, decided who will complete which “PART”. There may be more parts than there are members of your group, so start with just one part person. If you finish your part and other are still working, you can move on to an unclaimed part. <strong>It is crucial each person does their own part</strong> as this will help divide up the work and avoid merge conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you know which part you are working on, create a <strong>new branch</strong> and name that branch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">part-#</span></code> where the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span></code>” is replaces with the part number you’re going to work on. Use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>BRANCHNAME<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># using your appropriate &quot;part-#&quot; branch name</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Work on your part of the notebook and complete the task. Once you’ve successfully completed the task, <strong>clear all of the output and save the notebook</strong>. If you run into issues completing your part, talk with your group. Afterall, you’re part of a collaboration!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>One potentially new concept</strong> is how to access a file that is <em>not</em> in the same directory as the notebook you are working in. For example, this repository has all data files in a separate folder titled “data” rather than having all csv files in the same place as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River.ipynb</span></code> (this causes a “No such file or directory” error). You could just move the data files (with the mv command on the terminal!), but there is a <strong>faster and easier way!</strong> Instead, you can alter the code inside your pandas function to read in the data. Because the csv files live in the <strong>data</strong> folder, you need to specify that path: ‘data/csv file name’ so that your computer knows to look in the data folder for the file, not the current directory. No more error!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Add and commit your changes <strong>to your new branch</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch back to the main branch with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">main</span></code> and do a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> to see if anything has changed in the original repository. If the main branch has changed, you’ll want to follow the step above to try and merge those changes into your new branch. Again, if you run into issues ask your group or your instructor for help.</p></li>
<li><p>If there were no changes to the main branch or your managed to merge in any changes that were there, you’re going to <strong>push your new branch to the GitHub repository</strong>. You can do so with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>push<span class="w"> </span>origin<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>BRANCHNAME<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># using your appropriate &quot;part-#&quot; branch name</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Once you’ve pushed your branch, go to your repository on GitHub and confirm that your new branch has appeared by clicking on the “branches” label that should be hanging out above the list of repository files.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’re on the branches page for YOUR repository, try issuing a new pull request and notify your group that your pull request is available for review.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: when submitting a pull request, make sure you are submitting it to your <em>group member’s</em> forked repository, not the original repository.
You want the <strong>base repository</strong> to be your group member’s forked repository (not msu-cmse-courses/CMSE202_Git_Started). If you don’t confirm this, the pull request will be sent to the <em>original</em> repository, and your group mates won’t see you pull request in their cloned repository of the forked repository for the next step:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>From here, someone in your group will need to merge your pull request (yes, you could do it yourself, but this is not common practice!). You should kindly ask if someone would be willing to take a moment to review and merge your pull request. After they’ve done so, see if they need help finishing their part or if anyone else could use your help as well. <strong>If someone else’s pull request is merged before your’s, GitHub may tell you that you have merge conflicts that have to be resolved before the pull request can be merged. If this happens, you’ll need to go through the process of pulling new changes from the main branch and resolving the conflicts</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>A note about minimizing merge conflicts!</strong></em>
Sometimes, this process can be easier if group members take turns submitting pull requests. If you’re running into issues, let one group member pull, push their work, and then submit a pull request. Then another group member follows the same process, etc.</p>

-->
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li><p>Once your branch is successfully merged in, try pulling it into the main branch on your machine. You should also be able to pull in the changes from others eventually as well. If there’s extra time, feel free to create a new branch and tackle one of the remaining parts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>✅ <strong>Question 6:</strong> What part(s) of the notebook did you complete? If you ran into any issues completing the part(s) you were responsible for, make note of that here.</p>

<h3>3.1 Forking the repository (again)<a class="headerlink" href="#forking-the-repository-again" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>For the next part of this assignment, everyone who <strong>wasn’t</strong> the group leader who made the original fork of the course repository, will make a <strong>new fork of the <em>repository your group has been working on</em> not of the original course repository</strong>. Make a fork of your group’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMSE202_Git_Started</span></code> repository that you were just working on so that you now have your own personal copy. Since the leader already has a copy of that version, they can just use that repository.</p>
<p>Once you’ve “forked” your group repository and made your own, <strong>you should clone that repository into your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/CMSE202/repositories</span></code> directory as instructed here</strong>:</p>
<p>Everyone, <strong>including the leader</strong>, should clone a fresh copy of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMSE202_Git_Started</span></code> repository that they are the primary owner of. When you <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code> the repository into your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/CMSE202/repositories</span></code> folder, <strong>you should give it a slightly different name</strong>. It is suggested you slightly modify the folder name by adding your name or initials as a suffix/tag on the end. Something like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>URL<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span>CMSE202_Git_Started_YOURNAME<span class="sb">`</span>

<h3>3.2 Using version history and version control to move around in “time”<a class="headerlink" href="#using-version-history-and-version-control-to-move-around-in-time" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another feature that makes Git such a powerful tool is its ability to keep track of all the changes the repository goes through from one commit to the next. This allows for any user to go backwards and forwards in time and be able to see the repository as it stood at each commit.</p>
<section id="id1">
<h4>3.2.1:<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>We will be utilizing the version history and version control to “fix” the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Grand</span> <span class="pre">River</span></code> section of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River.ipynb</span></code> notebook. However, make sure that you are now in your <strong>newly forked repository</strong> and editing that version of notebook <strong>this is important</strong>. You’ll probably want to make sure you close down any previously opened versions to ensure you are working on the right now.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Do This</strong>: Open the notebook and see if you can spot where the error is (<em>Hint: Look at where it gets the data</em>). <strong>Discuss this with your group</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Question 9:</strong> What bug is there? What lines of code appears to be the problem?</p>

<p>One of your collaborators informs you that they recall that things were working before commit labeled “Updated the Grand River of notebook to pull Grand River Data from the web.” Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code> to confirm that this commit occured in your version of the repository! Prior to that commit that the section of the notebook was fully functioning.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Do this</strong>: “Close and halt” the Jupyer notebook (make sure you’ve completed exited from it). Then use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code> to find the commit that happened <em><strong>before</strong></em> the “Updated the Grand River to pull Grand River Data from the web” commit. Use this command to travel back to that commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>HASHNUMBER<span class="o">]</span>

</div>
<p><strong>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HASHNUMBER</span></code> is the number that follows the word “commit” in the git log.</strong></p>

<p>✅ <strong>Question 11:</strong> Re-open the notebook and review that section. What appears to be different about it? Where does the plot pull its data from? What is the name of the file? You can also view the commits in the GitHub web interface for your repository. Try looking at this commit and the two commits that come after it to see what was being changed. Comment on what you were able to figure out about these changes.</p>

<section id="id3">
<h4>3.2.3:<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Having done a little digging, you are now ready to “fix” the section. In order to do this, you can follow a general formula that should lead you to success</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>“Close and halt” the notebook again to make sure it’s closed. Then make sure you jump back to the current commit of the respository. You can do this by running the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">main</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before you make any edits, let’s be extra cautious and make a copy of the current notebook using a new, slightly different name (e.g <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River_YOURNAME.ipynb</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>If you can remember what needed to be changed in your new copy of the notebook, go ahead and do that. If you can’t remember what needed to be changed, you can go back to that older, correct version of the original notebook using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">[HASHNUMBER]</span> <span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River.ipynb</span></code> to revert the notebook back to its older self. You can use that old notebook as a reference to edit your new copy (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River_YOURNAME.ipynb</span></code>). Alternatively, you can avoid using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code> command and look at the old version and the edits on the GitHub interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve fixed things in your new copy, return the original notebook to it’s most recent state by doing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">[HASHNUMBER]</span> <span class="pre">Great_Lakes_and_Grand_River.ipynb</span></code> but this time use the HASHNUMBER for the most recent commit (which you can find using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Check to see if your new version of the notebook works as intended. You might still run into an error, especially if any important files are missing from the repository. The upside is that even if a file is missing, if it existed in the past, it can be brought back! If you need to being a file back that was deleted in the past, you can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>HASHNUMBER<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>MISSINGFILE<span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># &quot;MISSINGFILE&quot; should be the name of the file you wish to restore</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This should make the file appear and then you can re-commit it to your repository!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>At this point, ideally, you will have the original (broken) version of the notebook, the fixed copy you just made, and restored versions of any files that went missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you have two options, you can add and commit your copy of the notebook, or you can apply your fix to the original and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rm</span></code> your copy. The choice is yours!</p></li>
<li><p>To finish up, make sure your final version of the repository has been pushed to GitHub.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>✅ Do this</strong>: Using the above as a guide, <strong>fix the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Grand_River</span></code> section of the notebook.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once you are done, make sure to turn in your final version of the notebook you fixed along with this notebook on D2L</strong></p>
