    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">**Reminder**</font>: During the summer of 2021, GitHub updated their security protocols to prevent GitHub users from cloning private repositories using just their GitHub password. Instead of using passwords, GitHub requires that you set up a unique \"personal access token\" that expires after a predetermined amount of time to increase the overall security and privacy of GitHub-hosted repositories. You should have set one of these up in class, but if you didn't, lost track of the token, or the token no longer seems to be working you can set up one now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directions for setting up a personal access token can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token (**Note**: you only need to set up a personal access token with \"**repo**\" access for things to work).\n",
