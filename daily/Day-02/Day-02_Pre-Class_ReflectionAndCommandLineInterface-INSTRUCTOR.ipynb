When you run into software issues with your local installations, the instructors will do their best to help you troubleshoot these issues, but if they prove particularly troublesome, you may need to revert to JupyyterHub as a backup. For this pre-class notebook, you will be expected to use the JupyterHub for all of the command-line interface (CLI) components to get practice with it. After you practice with the command line interface in JupyterHub, you are encouraged to see if you can do the same thing locally on your computer by following the recommendations for setting everything up in the Software Setup Guide (available on the [course website](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-S25-jb/). Being able to run everything locally has the advantage of not relying on internet access, but it will not be required for you to succeed in the course."
