    "#### The goals for this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Students should be comfortable downloading data files from web addresses using curl\n",
    "* Students should also make sure that they can `pip` install things on their computer. If they are using JupyterHub they will need to do `pip install --user`. One caveat: for some packages `pip` doesn't always succeed in installing all of the correct dependencies. Additionally, running `pip` inside of a Jupyter Notebook can be risky, it would probably be better for them to become comfortable with doing all of their installation on the command line, but then they need to make sure they are installing things in the correct Python directory (i.e. the same one that is running their Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "* The end of the assignment is intended to be opened ended and exploratory. Can they get other packages to run? What happens when they run into issues? Geopandas is a notoriously challenging package to get correctly installed (especially when using `pip`) so watch out, but if they can get it working that's a bonus!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes for in-class meta-messaging\n",
    "* Remind students that learning to find and use useful Python packages is an important skills to develop and is something that they made be asked to do from time to time. This is a good opportunity to point out the value of good documentation!\n",
    "* Mention that this is not something they would have necessarily done before since we don't cover this in CMSE 201.\n",
    "* Encourage students to experiment and \"play\" a bit with these new packages. For their projects, they might find interesting tools that they can make sure of and getting comfortable with \"tinkering\" can be a good skill to develop.\n",
    "* It might also be worth pointing out that sometimes package installation can be trickier than it first looks and that there may be more than one way to get something installed correctly."
