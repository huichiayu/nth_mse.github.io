However, **the caveat to this is that you need to have permission to writing new files into your Python installation when using conda to install the package, which you do not have permission to on the MSU JupyterHub server**. If you've been only using JupyterHub for class at this point, that's totally OK, but you should still read about how to use `conda` for installing packages and then you can try to [install the same pacakge with pip instead](#pip-install).\n",
