    "We'll talk about measures of \"goodness\" of fit during the class, but one good measure for a multi-feature fit is the **Adjusted R-squared** value. In general, the **R-squared** describes the variance in the model that it can account for. If the R-squared is 1.0, then all the variance is accounted for an you have a perfect fit. If the value is 0 and you have no fit. However, for multiple features R-squared tends to over-estimate. The Adjusted R-squared tries to deal with this and provide a value that is better suited to multiple features.\n",
