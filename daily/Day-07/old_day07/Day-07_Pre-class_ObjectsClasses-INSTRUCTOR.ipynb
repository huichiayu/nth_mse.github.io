    "We've previously learned how functions can perform various tasks by grouping together commonly performed tasks to be called from different parts of the script (or notebook). But every function needs data to work on: a function for multiplication requires at least 2 numbers to multiply, the `len` function requires a string, a list, or an array to return its length, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we **combine the data and functions** into one data structure, we get **objects**. The object, like in a real world, combine both the `data` (i.e. the _attributes_ of the object) and the methods (or functions) that can perform manipulations with the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things even more interesting, everything in Python is an object: integer, string, list, and dictionary. Every object has data associated with (for the integer, this is the value, an integer number) and there is a list of functions we can perform on a given object. Examples of objects that you already encountered before are `numpy` arrays, lists, dictionaries, and Pandas DataFrames.\n",
