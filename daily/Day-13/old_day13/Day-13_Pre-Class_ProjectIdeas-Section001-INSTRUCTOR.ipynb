    "In this pre-class assignment we are going to explore your project ideas for class.  The ideas are pulled from the project brainstorming you did previously. The instructional staff did their best to interpret the concept of your ideas based on what you submitted to the previous pre-class survey. In some cases we had to try to put vagues thoughts into concrete categories and we may have misconstrued the original intent -- sorry if your idea was mangled! Also, to make the list a manageably-sized, we tried to combine some ideas and couldn't include every single idea. If your idea didn't make the list, it doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea. You all did a wonderful job brainstorming!\n",
