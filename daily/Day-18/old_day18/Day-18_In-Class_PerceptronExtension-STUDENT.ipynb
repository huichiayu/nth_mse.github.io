You may need to make some modifications to your code if you didn't build it to be flexible enough to accept an arbitary number of data deatures. Experiment with the learning rate and number of iterations to see how high of an accuracy you can get with your classifier.\n",

    "3. If you get your Perceptron classifier working, can you figure out how to use the Perceptron Classifier that is available in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)? You may need to do a bit of Google searching and exploration of the documentation to figure this out. How well does the scikit-learn version do compared to the one you built?\n",
