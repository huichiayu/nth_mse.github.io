    "#### The goals/notes for this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The original goal for this assignment was for the students to spend some time grappling with the challenges of building a KNN algorithm from scratch to follow off of the idea presented in the pre-class about trying to ensure that cell phone towers to not end up with too much overlapping frequency.\n",
    "* The KNN algorithm ends up being quite challenging for some students, which can lead to this being a frustrating day. It might be worth trying to guide this assignment a little bit more by suggesting that they create distance matrix using SciPy and then have them figure out how to use their distance matrix to find the KNN neighbors, giving them this piece still makes them figure out the \"tricky\" part of the algorithm, but might avoid situations where students head down a path to nowhere. If students can get the KNN stuff working more quickly. That should give them more time playing with the visualization part of the assignment, which should lead to a more satisfying result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-class meta-messaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the beginning of class to discuss issues that came up in the pre-class survey. For questions about how to solve the nearest-neighbor question, you can point out that one possible solution is include in the notebook and walk the class through that solution\n",
    "* Explain to students that the KNN algorithm might take them a bit of time to figure out.\n",
    "* Explain that while we're thinking about KNN as being a tool for identifying neighbors based on physical separation, this could be applied to any sort of feature space, which is worth thinking about from a machine learning context.\n",
    "* If they run out of time, there might be an opportunity to revisit this in the next class period."

    "In order to avoid this overlap cell phone companies use different frequency ranges in the Electromagnetic spectrum.  Two towers that are close together but have differences in frequencies (shown as colors, red/green/black in the following figure) do not cause nearly as much interference. \n",
