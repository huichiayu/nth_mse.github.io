    "   - `set_specialty`: set specialty of the person by defining which animal the person can be responsible for and how many of them they are capable of taking care of\n",

    "**&#9989; Do This:** Try to perform a more detailed check to see if the zoo is understaffed or if they have enough people to take care of all animals in the zoo. This time the check will be done to ensure that there are enough properly training zookeepers to take care of the variety of animals in the Zoo. The code should print all of the different types of animals in the zoo, along with number of available and required zookeepers to care for those animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** The task is similar to the last task for part 3, but now you need to check on an animal by animal basis. You can use a dictionary for storing information about available and required number of people for each animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** If you used non-integer numbers for number of animals each zookeeper can handle and/or for number of zookeepers is required for individual animal, do not forget to round the number of people at the end of the loop over animals. The required number of people should be rounded up, available number of people should be rounded down."
