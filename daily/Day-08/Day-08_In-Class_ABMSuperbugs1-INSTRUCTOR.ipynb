    "\n",
    "* Student should spend some time practicing and thinking about implementing classes. The bulk of the time in this assignment is spend figuring out how to initialize the \"petri dish\" with the right sort of antibiotic values and bugs with random genes.\n",
    "    * Note that not everything is perfectly laid out in the model details, there are some aspects that they have to decide on with their groups. There is a free response prompt that gets at this.\n",
    "* Students should be thinking about this in the context of building and agent-based model, which should be topic that have some comfort with from 201\n",
    "* Students should have the opportunity to practice using \"stub functions\" to build their new Python class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes for in-class meta-messaging:\n",
    "* Depending on how things go, they might not get all the way through to the point of getting something functioning, but that's OK. We will be picking up on this model next class as well. They should do their best to get something working but they'll be able to finish/improve upon it during the beginning of the next class period.\n",
    "* Encourage students to discuss ways that they can set this up with their group and that there's not necessarily one right way to do this.\n",
    "* Remind students that the goal is to practice using classes. Two obvious classes: the petri dish and a single bacteria. What information would these need to store? What should the initialization step look like for each? What role would composition play? (e.g. the petri dish might store a list of bug objects).\n",
    "* Section 4: We can briefly talk about RGB color and gray scale image ([1 1 1] and [0 0 0] are white and black, respectively.) When the vector has same value of the three components, it shows only the intensity (gray scale)."
