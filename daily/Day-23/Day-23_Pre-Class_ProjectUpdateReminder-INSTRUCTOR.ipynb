    "    * The question you’re answering (this should be a refined/revised version of the question your group was formed based on)\n",
    "    * A brief description of your methodology (no more than two sentences) and a list of the Python tools you are using.\n",
    "    * Your results up to this point, in the form of visualizations\n",
    "    * The conclusions you’ve drawn from these preliminary results\n",
    "    * Plans for finishing your project\n",
