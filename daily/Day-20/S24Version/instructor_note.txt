For Day 23's ICA, students present project updates. Each project group
will have 4 minutes to give a short presentation to the rest of the class.
You should set up a Day 23 submission folder on D2L to provide a place for
students to upload their final presentation slides (even if they already
put a copy in the PCA folder).
