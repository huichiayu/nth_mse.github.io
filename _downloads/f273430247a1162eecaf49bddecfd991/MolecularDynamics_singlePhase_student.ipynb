    "# Molecular dynamics hands-on Python coding practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook file serves as a gateway to enter the realm of Python programming and molecular dynamics. We'll break down the basic MD loop to several code cells, step-by-step. The main purpose of this coding assignment is to horn your Python programming skills. The first part will be creating multiple arrays, as containers, to store atoms' information such as positions, velocity, acceleration, interatomic relative position vector, forces, etc. The second part will be run time iterations to calculate atomic foreces, accelerations, and update atomic positions. Note that the material parameters are arbitrarily set up. You'll need to use realistic parameters if you want to simulate a real system.\n",

(Python has many different contrainers; for example, list, dictionary, tuple, set, etc. They have diferent properties and usages. We're not going over them today.)
