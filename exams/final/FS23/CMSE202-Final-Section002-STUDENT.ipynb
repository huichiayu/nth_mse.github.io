    "The goal of this final is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed having now finished CMSE 202. In particular, you'll be committing and pushing repository changes to a GitHub repository, working with data to build a network graph, performing regression analysis, and classifying data using a machine learning classifier. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam having completed the second half of CMSE 202!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, you'll probably want to make sure you do Part 1 first to ensure that your GitHub repository is working correctly. Let your instructor know right away if you run into issues!\n",

    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",

    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero. If you're completing the exam virtually, the same standards of academic integrity apply!"
