In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, performing some data analysis, possibly using a new Python package, and writing a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
