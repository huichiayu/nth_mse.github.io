## Computational Materials Science and Materials Data Science

### Course Description

This course is designed as a gateway course for graduate students. It will showcase modeling and simulation methods for mesoscale and microscale morphology evolution in materials, covering topics such as diffusion, phase transformation, precipitation, solidification, grain growth, eutectic growth, crystal growth, sintering, electrodeposition, spinodal decomposition, and crack propagation. First, students will be exposed to atomic-scale simulation methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo (MC) methods, and extend to microstructure evolutions. We will then focus on continuum-scale methods, specifically phase-field approaches, to simulate mass transport and phase transformation based on kinetic and thermodynamic descriptions. Finally, we will study emerging data science modeling methods for material phenomena. Students will learn these materials science modeling techniques via hands-on coding exercises.

THIS COURSE WILL GIVE YOU...  

1. Some background mathematics and relevant science
2. Some overview of modeling and simulation methods in materials science
3. Introduction to methods such as Phase Field Model, Finite Difference Method, Fourier Spectrum Method, Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo Method, (Finite Element Method if possible)
4. Practice in using computational materials science tools and scientific computing through homework, projects, and lab sessions.

We will work toward the goals expressed above throughout this course using a range of activities – primarily by lectures and by writing software, but also through discussion, presentations, and other types of exercises.  

### Topics covered

The primary topics covered in this course include:    

* Intro to DFT and MD simulations with simple hands-on coding practices 
* Intro to MC simulations with Random walk, Ising model, and Diffusion limited aggregation 
* Basics of finite difference method
* Time stepping methods (e.g., Euler and Runge-Kutta)
* Thermodynamics free energy
* Allen-Cahn (Ginzburg-Landau) phase field model for nucleation and growth
* Cahn-Hilliard phase field model for spinodal decomposition
* Solidifications, Eutectic transformation
* Grain growth, Sintering, Solid-solid phase transformation
* Crystal growth if time permits
* Crack propagation if time permits
* Emerging machine learning methods on materials science applications.


Please note that **creating models to describe and understand systems** (whether they are in the physical, life, or social sciences, or in engineering) is the driving principle of this course – everything else we teach you is in service to this goal!    

### Required reading materials

This class has no required book or course pack. From time to time you will be directed toward outside online resources, but the main materials will be instructor course notes and coding assignment files.    

### Required materials for class

In this course, the in-class programming assignments are a critical part of the learning process in this course. To that end, you will need to ensure that you have the following when you come to class:  

* A laptop computer, its power cord, and the ability to connect with the campus wifi. If possible, it would be useful to bring whatever adapter is necessary for you to connect with the classroom monitors so that you can share your computer screen with your fellow classmates.
* In case we are forced to go virtual, you should ensure that you have the ability to run the Zoom video conferencing software, which you can download here: [https://zoom.us/zh-tw/download](https://zoom.us/zh-tw/download)
* Should it become necessary for virtual classes, Here is the Zoom link [MeetingID: 947 2009 0066](https://msu.zoom.us/j/94720090066) and passcode (262506).

The details regarding the software needed for this course are provided in the “**[Software Setup Guide](./SoftwareSetupGuide.md)**,” which is linked to on the homepage of the course website.    

### Course activities

**Class participation**: Active, in-person class participation (led by the instructor) is critical to the success of this course. As such, you are expected to attend class every week and to actively participate in the in-class discussions and programming activities. If you are unable to attend class, you should contact your instructor to determine how you can best participate in the course and successfully complete the required activities.

**In-class programming assignments**: Intermittently, class will be broken up into groups to work on in-class programming assignments. This will allow you to immediately implement (and get instant feedback on) what you have just learned. In-class programming activities will be turned in via online drop box links provided on the course webpage either at the end of the class session or in a designated period. 

**Pre-class study assignments**: Occasionally, we will assign short study assignments prior to class. The purpose of these assignments is to introduce new material and give you some practice with it so that we can focus on implementation during class. These assignments will typically consist of one or more short videos or reading assignments and related questions or problems. **Completing these assignments will be critical for your success in this course**.


* Programming assignments need to be submitted by the deadline for full credit. A 24 hrs grace period is permitted to turn in work at a penalty.

**Homework**:  You will have periodic homework assignments (ideally 5 assignments throughout the semester) that will provide a more in-depth exploration of the materials covered in class. These will be pursued individually and will be turned in by the given deadline. In general, homework assignments will cover roughly 2-3 weeks’ worth of material. You can expect that they will require 2-3 weeks’ worth of out-of-class effort, so you are encouraged to start your assignments as early as possible.

Homework assignments that are submitted late will be accepted **for up to two days beyond the due date **(i.e., 48 hours past the original deadline)**. If the assignment is submitted within 24 hours of the original deadline, there is a 10% penalty**. This applies even if the assignment is 1 minute late. Similarly, **if it is submitted in the 24-48 hour window, a 20% deduction is applied**. Again, **after the 48th hour, the assignment will no longer be accepted**. If you need additional extensions or withhold the late penalty for extenuating circumstances, you must contact the instructor **before** the assignment is due to discuss this.

**Quiz/Exam**: Short quizzes (ideally 2-3) will be used to assess students’ learning outcomes. Each will be worth a small fraction of the overall exam grade. Should we decide to make change of the quiz policy, you will be notified well in advance of such decision.

**Semester Project**: This class will have an individual end-of-semester project. An ideal project is to implement the computational modeling and data analysis techniques that you learned over the course of the term to your existing research work, such that students get most out of the class efforts. You will present your project in writing and in an oral presentation. Along the course of the semester, project proposals and updates are required, and the instructor will discuss the progress and provide suggestions to you.

* Submitting late work (without instructors' prior agreements based-on justifiable reasons) in order to make-up or improve your grade is not allowed.



### Course meeting times and locations

You are expected to attend all scheduled class sessions. The time and locations can be found on the [home page](../index.md) of this course website.
 If you need to miss class for any reason, you should notify you instructor as soon as you are able. Instructor details and contact information, along with section meeting times, are available on the front page of this website.

### Other important information

**Course Website**:  This course has a website where important information regarding the course will be posted (e.g. syllabus, schedule, office hours calendar, etc): [https://huichiayu.github.io/nthu_mse.github.io]( https://huichiayu.github.io/nthu_mse.github.io/index.html)

**Email**: At times, we will send out important course information via email.  This email is sent to your MSU email address (the one that ends in “@msu.edu”).  You are responsible for all information sent out to your University email account, and for checking this account on a regular (daily) basis.

**Inclusive classroom behavior**:  Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes not interrupting other students, refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices or additional software during class sessions, and not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions. Flagrant or repeated violations of this expectation may result in ejection from the classroom and/or grade-related penalties. In particular, behavior that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate NTHU office.

In addition, we welcomes a full spectrum of experiences, viewpoints, and intellectual approaches because they enrich the conversation, even as they challenge us to think differently and grow. However, we believe that expressions and actions that demean individuals or groups comprise the environment for intellectual growth and undermine the social fabric on which the community is based. These demeaning behaviors are not welcome in this classroom.

**Academic Honesty**:  Intellectual integrity is the foundation of the scientific enterprise. In all instances, you must do your own work and give proper credit to all sources that you use in your papers and oral presentations – **any instance of submitting another person’s work, ideas, or wording as your own counts as plagiarism**. This includes deliberately failing to cite any direct quotations or computer code in the assignments you submit for this course. Generally, all universities require that any cheating offense, regardless of the magnitude of the infraction or punishment decided upon by the professor, be reported immediately to the unit’s administration.

It is important to note that **plagiarism in the context of this course includes, but is not limited to, directly copying another student’s solutions to assignments that are expected to be completed individually (class programming assignments, homework problems, and quizzes); copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation, or having somebody else do your individual assignments (class programming assignments, homework problems, and quizzes) on your behalf**. Any work that is done in collaboration with other students should state this explicitly, and their names as well as yours should be listed clearly. When collaborating with other students, you should still be coding/writing your own solutions to the assignments and should limit your collaboration to conceptual discussions about how one might go about solving the problems, **not sharing exact solutions**.

**Generative AI Policy**: [MSE 590400 Generative AI Policy](./MSE590400_AI_policy.md).  Please note that given the rapid evolution of generative AI technologies, this policy may evolve over time to adapt to new developments and challenges.


**Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting**: College students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibilities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression. Our goal is to help create a safe learning environment and to support you through these situations and experiences. We hope that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in written work, and in one-on-one meetings. We will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, we will share information regarding sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or information about criminal activity on campus with the university administrations. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting NTHU Counseling and Psychiatric Service.
