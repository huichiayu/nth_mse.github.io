## Honors option, CMSE 202 Fall 2023


You can complete an honors option for this course. You can do either of the following approaches for the Honors Option:

1. **Independent Data Science Project:** This requires that you complete an additional project on a topic that is different from the group project you are already required to complete. To follow this approach, please prepare a draft research question that you would like to try to answer in your project (this does not need to be your final question/direction;  it is intended to start your exploration for your project).  Example research questions:
	- *How well do winter weather patterns in the midwest predict tourism levels in the United States throughout the year?*
	- *Is there an association between sales tax levels and educational outcomes (K-12 success rates) for different states?*
	- *Are video game sales and trends related to public health outcomes?  Hypothesis: increased video game usage and sedentary activities negatively impacts health.*

2. **Educational Module:** Prepare a pre-class and in-class assignment, similar to assignments in CMSE 201 and 202, to teach additional concepts.  The project will include clear learning objectives and multiple modes of instruction (videos, graphics, coding, etc).  To follow this approach, prepare 1-2 sentences describing new content that will be introduced (this can be draft phase for now).  


**Honors project proposals must be submitted and approved before the middle of the semester**.

When submitting a Honors Option request form, through the [<https://reg.msu.edu/>](reg.msu.edu) student form system, use the following text in the description box: 

> This honors option requires me to complete a data science project in addition to the final semester project. The deliverables for this project are: source files for any relevant code, a jupyter notebook where the data analysis and/or computational modeling is performed, a video presentation in which I present my findings, a PDF of the slides I used in the presentation, and any other relevant files. The project topic will be discussed with the instructor and finalized after the middle of the semester. I understand than in order to earn the honors option credit, I must receive an overall grade of 3.0 or higher and an honors project grade of 80% or higher.

> The current plan is for me to [A. address the research question _____, or B. prepare a set of educational materials to teach ________].
