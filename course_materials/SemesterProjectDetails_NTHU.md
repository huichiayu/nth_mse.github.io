# CMSE 202

## Semester Project Details

The goal of the semester project is to provide you with the opportunity to pursue a computational modeling or data analysis project that you find interesting.

Since part of the focus of CMSE 202 is understanding how to use pre-existing computational tools, your project should involve identifying any publicly-available, python-based packages or libraries that can aid in your completion of the project. Additionally, your project should intentionally strive to go beyond the tools and techniques you learned in CMSE 201 and leverage new-to-you python packages (whether they be ones you're exposed to in 202 or ones you discover on your own), new modeling and data analysis approaches, and new programming techniques (e.g. Python classes).

For the project, you are expected to work **with a group** to accomplish the following:

1. Define a question (or questions) that you think you can answer either by analyzing a publicly available dataset and/or by building/using a computational model.
2. Acquire any data necessary to pursue your question(s).
3. Identify any pre-existing python-based libraries or packages that can be used to aid in answering the question(s).
4. Familiarize yourself with the data/libraries/packages and make sure you're aware of their limitations.
5. Write the code necessary to run your model or analyze your data.
6. Present the results to the class in the form of a 10-15 minute talk with slides, plots, code, etc.
